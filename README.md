## How to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` in both frontend and backend folders to install all the necessary packages.
3. Use `node .\server.js` to run the backend from the backend folder, then do `npm start` from the frontend folder. If asked to start from a different port, say yes since port 3000 is being used by the backend.

## Description
This Word Scramble Game is designed to offer a rich, enjoyable, and versatile user experience. It combines aesthetic choices, gameplay mechanics, and accessibility features to create an engaging game suitable for all ages.

### Aesthetic Design

## Reflection
I aimed to create a game that is not only fun but also user-friendly and accessible. I focused on the minute details like color themes and sound effects to enhance the user experience. With more time, I would have liked to add features like multi-player functionality and different language options.

## Feedback
This project was an excellent opportunity to polish my web dev skills. It allowed me to focus on both backend logic and frontend design, offering a well-rounded development experience.
